problem statement:
for local bike hire business, the process is too manual. the shops have
old books where they record their customers. when someone wants to rent a bike,
they must have their details written manually. start time is recorded, and the user 
is given a bike of choice. the user leaves basic details such as name and phone which are 
recorded manually. also the rentee must leave a collateral (mostly phone) which will be recovered when he/she
returns bike.

after retuning bike, thereturn time is recorded and duration manually calculated.
the time is converted into amount to charge. then the user is given back his/her phone
to pay. payment is manual.

i am developing Speedy, a simple tool to make this process lesser painful for the business.
eliminate the manual recording. and eliminate manual payment. just stk push. create for me a 
simple, professional website for this application. use tailwind cdn for styling.


- ammendments:
* remove emojis, use professional icons. use font awesome CDN
* incluse that the system can work offline using USSD. the onboarding is very simple.
* emphasize that the application is easy to use. very easy
* the app supports bikes with different rates of charge
* replace the "Request demo" section with Log In. add "Forgot password", create account, etc
* add a cover on top. cover image that is responsive. it displays the parent company
